Welcome to my Tic-Tac-Toe game project!

This game offers two thrilling modes of play:

1. Player vs. AI
2. Player vs. Player

In the Player vs. AI mode, the game utilizes the powerful min-max algorithm to provide an exciting and challenging experience for all players.

Feel free to explore both modes and enjoy the game to the fullest!
